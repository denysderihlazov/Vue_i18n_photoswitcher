Vue_i18n_photoswitcher 

This is a project which will help you to understand how to use Vue i18n and translate the project content from JSON. 
As a bonus I made workshop how to switch .png `<img>` by switching localization. All images (`all.png` and `mathbg.png`) and background were drawn by me.  

### How set up the project:
```
cd /any_folder_you_want/
git clone https://github.com/denysderihlazov/Vue_i18n_photoswitcher.git
cd Vue_i18n_photoswitcher
npm install
```

### How to run project:

```
npm run serve
```
